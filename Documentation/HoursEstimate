Total Time: 12 hours estimated

Review Code and refresh/learn Racket Fundementals : 2 hours
- Make sure all functionality from Project 1 is met and understand how to work with Racket
- Hard to know how long it will take (depends on effectiveness of other team)

Set up Github for Project 2: 30 minutes
- Create non-master branch with new documentation and project code
- Should be fairly simple/quick

UML Custom Feature Design: 1 hour
- Create visual model to show relationship of new feature to previous code
- Necessitates time given to both deciding on and designing new feature

Adding AI Component: 4 hours
- Implementing a single-player game mode where the user plays an AI with multiple possible difficulty levels
- Should take a while to implement each of Easy, Medium, and Hard game modes

Adding Custom Feature: 2 hours
- Implementing special shot that fires at a whole row or column (can only be used by each player once a game)
- Should be simpler than AI component but still will require some time

Final Touches/Error Testing: 2.5 hours
- Making sure program runs correctly and is fully implemented with new additions
- Could be much shorter or much longer depending on how many bugs we run into
